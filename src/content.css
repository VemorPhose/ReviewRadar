/* Styles for ReviewRadar content script elements */

/* 
  We aim to use Tailwind utility classes as much as possible, 
  injected via the content script itself or from the popup's styles if they are global.
  However, if very specific overrides or base styles for injected elements are needed,
  they can go here.

  Example:
  .review-radar-badge-custom {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; 
  }
*/
